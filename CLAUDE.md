# Project Instructions

This is the canonical instruction file for AI coding agents working in this repository.

Before finishing code changes, run:

```bash
npm run check
```

For lint-only or style-only changes, run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Use Biome warnings as useful feedback. Do not weaken rules just to silence React hook dependency warnings unless there is a documented reason.

The commit hook runs Biome on staged files, so keep changes passing:

```bash
npm run lint:staged
```
