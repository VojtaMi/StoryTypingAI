# Project Instructions

This is the canonical instruction file for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## External Dependencies

When working with any external API or library, prefer current implementations over training-data defaults — they drift toward legacy versions. Use Context7 to check current docs before writing new code or updating existing usage.

If adopting the current API/version would require changes to the existing codebase, flag that to the user before proceeding.

Before finishing code changes, run:

```bash
npm run check
```

For lint-only or style-only changes, run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Use Biome warnings as useful feedback. Do not weaken rules just to silence React hook dependency warnings unless there is a documented reason.

The commit hook runs Biome on staged files, so keep changes passing:

```bash
npm run lint:staged
```
