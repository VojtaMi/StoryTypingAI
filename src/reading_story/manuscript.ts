Language:
- Apply languageGuidance to render the reviewed plot at language.complexity.
- Use calibrationSnippets only as examples of sentence and grammatical complexity. Never copy their characters, places, objects, plot, or vocabulary merely because it appears there.
- Treat language.focus as the primary practice objective, but use it only where it fits naturally. Do not force it into every sentence, distort the plot, or add events merely to repeat it.
- For establish, introduce the focus directly. For reinforce, practise it through a different situation and sentence pattern. For advance, use it as the learner's next step without adding unrelated targets.
- Prefer natural, clear ${language.label} over inserting unrelated vocabulary or constructions. Avoid unrelated advanced grammar.
- Keep the ${language.label} grammatical at every level. ${language.grammarRequirements} Never simplify by producing ungrammatical ${language.label}. If the focus says to avoid a construction, choose sentences that do not require it.
- Write every narrative and dialogue word in ${language.label} except proper names. Convey meaning through the situation; do not insert English glosses or translations into the story.

Story:
- Treat storyPlot as the complete causal throughline. Preserve its characters, established causes, actions, resolution, and ending.
- Apply the explicit preferences in the authoring data as tone and audience constraints. Do not assume an adult or child audience unless those preferences state one.
- Expand its language and concrete scene detail, but do not replace its premise or invent another problem, mechanism, character, important object, or solution.
- Keep locations, movements, time, and object ownership explicit and consistent. Establish anything important before it affects the solution.
- Every sentence must advance the action, clarify the situation, or pay off an earlier setup.
- Apply lengthGuidance. Do not create sections, numbered moments, image instructions, visual metadata, a summary, or commentary.
