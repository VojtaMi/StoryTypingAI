# Architecture

The app has one product workflow: finite reading stories.

```text
language registry → prepare complete story → reveal sections → recap
                  → finalize evidence → prepare the next story
```

## Responsibility areas

| Area | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `src/languages.ts` | Language identity and pedagogy, plus shared derivation of prompts, starter defaults, speech instructions, and asset paths. |
| `src/App.tsx`, `src/languageSelection.ts` | Window-specific language selection, URL/history, document title, and top-level views. |
| `src/home_menu/` | Language switch, settings, starting/resuming stories, and current-language saves. |
| `src/story_session/` | Preparing, starting, advancing, resuming, persisting, and finalizing a story. |
| `src/exercise_screen/` | Reading, word popovers, tutor chat, recap, and feedback interactions. |
| `src/exercise_screen/story/storyPractice.css` | The recap, completion, and feedback visual system for reading-story practice. |
| `src/reading_story/`, `src/story.ts` | Whole-story generation contracts, validation, splitting, and visual plan. |
| `src/server/` | Provider calls, prepared queues, saved files, evidence, and generated media. |

The browser sends a `LanguageId` with every language-sensitive request. Server
code resolves the canonical registry entry rather than trusting browser-supplied
prompt text. Adding a language should extend that registry and provide its hero
and bot assets, without adding a parallel application.

The selected language is part of the URL (`/<language>`), so two tabs can practice different
languages. Changing it returns that tab to its menu and remounts its reading
session. Shared taste settings intentionally do not change; language-specific
stories and progression are selected or keyed by `genreId`.

## Reading lifecycle

The prepared queue holds at most one complete story per language. The first uses
that language's absolute-beginner starter brief. Finishing a story distills its
word lookups, tutor questions, recap, and feedback into one validated successor
brief. Story memory records include `genreId` and generation sees only matching
records.

A saved story lives in the browser's IndexedDB store and is addressed by
`/<language>/story/<story-id>`. It contains the complete manuscript and its
section cursor. Resume restores it without prose generation. The session's media owner deduplicates
narration and illustration work, seeds already-generated media, and prepares the
next section while the current one is read.

## Placement rule

- Navigation and language selection belong in `App` or `home_menu`.
- Lifecycle, persistence, and generation timing belong in `story_session`.
- Interaction mechanics belong in `exercise_screen`.
- Language differences belong in the registry unless a provider requires a
  genuinely distinct adapter.
- Provider and local-file concerns belong in `server`.
